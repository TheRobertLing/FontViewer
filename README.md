# FontViewer

A simple browser-based tool for inspecting font files, powered by opentype.js. This website was inspired by [FontDrop](https://fontdrop.info) and aims to provide a simpler interface for browsing and extracting font data. The site is still in its early stages, but expect it to grow into a more substantial tool over time.
